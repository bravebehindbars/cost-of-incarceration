                    <p>Our mission is to bring the truth about incarceration into the public eye by compiling credible statics, data and information and sharing that information nationwide. We are committed to reducing mass incarceration by criminal reform. A system where offenders are truly given an environment where they can be rehabilitated into good neighbors and productive citizens. We stand to reduce prison populations through reform, advocacy and by promoting alternatives to incarceration such as home confinement, SUD rehabilitation programs and parole. We aim to keep families together, reduce crime rates, lower the poverty level, and reduce judicial abuses such as prosecutorial misconduct, wrongful convictions, coerced plea bargains, and above all, to keep human beings out of cages in the 21st century. We are here to prove that the archaic practice of imprisoning people DOES NOT WORK. The proof is already there, we are here to bring it to light. We are striving to better our nation through true liberty and justiceâ€¦ for all.</p>

            <div class="statsbody">
                <p> We believe it would never happen to us, that justice in America always gets the right guy... but thats not the truth. According the the Innocence Project website, around 6% of the roughly two million people incarcerated in the US are innocent. It doesn't sound like a lot untill you do the math: thats roughly 120,000 people wrongly accused, wrongly imprisoned and wrongfuly marked for life. That's not justice, thats a nightmare. Incarceration does more than "cage the bad guys". It destroys families, communities and lives. Felons can't find work once released because of the "Felon" brand permenantly attached to their records. Children grow up without a parent, often in poverty without that parents income. Communites have to support those families, able bodied workers are taken from the pool and the cycle continues to the next generation. What happened to being incarcerated to pay our debt to society? If we are forver marked, is our debt ever paid? Why when we leave prison are we not "all square"?  The Judicial system of the US is in dire need of remodeling. But if we all keep turning a blind eye nothing changes... and it will be to late when it happens to you or someone you love.</p>
